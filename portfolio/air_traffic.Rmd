An air traffic  organization wants to create a real-time air traffic analysis and prediction application that can be used to analyse and control traffic congestion at large airports.
Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) receivers had to be installed and collected data should be shared with a community-based receiver network to be able to have disposition on a larger dataset from the community. The ADS-B data needs to be coupled with weather data from NOAAâ€™s National Weather Service and internal air traffic geo-spatial data.

The objectives of this application are summarized as:
    
* Measure runway occupancy times and wake vortex separations by investigating ADS-B aircraft surveillance data..
* Determine under what conditions runway occupancy becomes the limiting factor for runway throughput
* Evaluate inter-arrival separations and identify potential opportunities for reduced minimum separations.
* Quantify runway capacity benefits of reduced wake separation concepts.


Trefoil analytics helped building a big data infrastructure starting by installing a couple an ADS-B receiver to collect and process aircraft tracks data. Real time tracks data is combined with near real-time weather data and other aviation data to build analytical applications to quantitatively review airspace/airport performance, operational efficiency and aviation safety
